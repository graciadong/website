**About me**: I am currently a CANSSI postdoctoral fellow working with [Patrick Brown](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/patrick-brown) from the University of Toronto and [Laura Cowen](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/people/home/faculty/cowen_laura.php) from the University of Victoria. I am physically based at Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital. In my spare time, ~~I am an avid enjoyer of video games and cosplay~~ I am primarily responsible for keeping a [small human](https://www.instagram.com/markusdong22/) alive.
For a more comprehensive list of my experience, see the [Research]({{< ref "research.md" >}}) and [Teaching]({{< ref "teaching.md" >}}) tabs.

I sometimes post my thoughts and feelings on my [Blog]({{< ref "blog/_index.md" >}}).

If you want to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email address under the [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) tab.
