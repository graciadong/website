<!--- **About me**: -->

**Update**: I will begin a new role as Assistant Professor, Teaching Stream, Human Biology and Statistics, at the University of Toronto in July 2024.  

I am currently a [CANSSI postdoctoral fellow](https://canssi.ca/story/cdpf-gracia-dong/) working with [Dr. Patrick Brown](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/patrick-brown) from the University of Toronto and [Dr. Laura Cowen](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/people/home/faculty/cowen_laura.php) from the University of Victoria.
My research is done in collaboration with [Island Health](https://www.islandhealth.ca/), and I am physically based at [Centre for Global Health Research](https://www.cghr.org/). 

In my spare time, ~~I am an avid enjoyer of video games, musical theater, and cosplay~~ I am primarily responsible for keeping a [small human](https://www.instagram.com/markusdong22/) alive. My PhD was obtained from the University of Waterloo, under the supervision of [Dr. Christiane Lemieux](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/clemieux), where I worked on constructions and applications of quasi-random point sets with negative dependence. 

Please see the [Research]({{< ref "research.md" >}}) and [Teaching]({{< ref "teaching.md" >}}) tabs for a list of my work.
My statements on teaching and EDI can be found in my [Blog]({{< ref "blog.md" >}}).

<!--- If you want to get in touch, you can find my social media links and email address under the [Contact]({{< ref "contact.md" >}}) tab. -->
