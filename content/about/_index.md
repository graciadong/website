**About me**: I am currently a CANSSI postdoctoral fellow working with [Patrick Brown](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/patrick-brown) from the University of Toronto and [Laura Cowen](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/people/home/faculty/cowen_laura.php) from the University of Victoria. I am physically based at Centre for Global Health Research at St. Michaelâ€™s Hospital. In my spare time, ~~I am an avid enjoyer of video games and cosplay.~~ I am primarily responsible for keeping a [small human](https://www.instagram.com/markusdong22/) alive.
