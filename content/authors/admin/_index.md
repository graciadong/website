I am first year PhD student at the University of Waterloo under joint supervision of Prof. Greg Rice and Joel Dubin. My current research is in Functional Data Analysis, particularly in Functional Time Series Analysis.

Previously, I obtained MSc and BSc degrees at the University of Victoria in a beautiful city, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.
