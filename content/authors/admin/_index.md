I am a second year PhD student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca) under joint supervision of Prof. [Greg Rice](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/about/people/grice) and Prof. [Joel Dubin](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/joel-dubin), who is the host of [Health Data Science Lab (HDSL)](https://uwaterloo.ca/health-data-science-lab/). This term, I also work for Prof. [Martin Lysy](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/people-profiles/martin-lysy) at [Statistical Consulting and Collaborative Research Unit (SCCRU)](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistical-consulting-and-collaborative-research-unit/). My other personal website hosted by UWaterloo server can be found [here](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/c26yeh/home) or click the stunning face emoji!

Before arriving in Waterloo, I obtained MSc and BSc degrees at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) supervised by Prof. [Julie Zhou](https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/people/home/faculty/zhou_julie.php) in a beautiful city, [Victoria](https://www.victoria.ca/), British Columbia, Canada.

In my spare time, I like to play basketball, and reading books, articles and random posts.
