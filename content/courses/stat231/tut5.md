This week (Friday, July-25-2019), I will be teaching tutorial sections (12:30 -- 13:20 in DC 1351)

In this tutorial, we'll go over [Quiz 3, Version A](../supp/tut5_Q.pdf) which students wrote last week.

* * * 

### MC questions

1 [C] p.182, definition 38.

2 [B] Similar to tutorial 4, if the null value is **not located in the interval**, then most likely the $H_o$ is **false**.

3 [D] p. 218, 

> To fit the line which minimizes the sum of squares of the distances between the observed points, ($x_i,y_i$), $i=1,2,\dots,n$, and the fitted line $y=\alpha+\beta x$.

* Vertical direction.

4 [D] The model is $y=\alpha+\beta x$, so the corresponding p-value for $\beta$ is $0.0000251$.

5 [A] $$\hat{\mu}=\hat{y}=15.2207+1.0414*5=20.4277$$

6 [D] 

* Small sample (n=14)

* $\bar{y}=266.5$ and $s=18.6$ (sample standard deviation)

* Two sided $H_a$ as "this type is difference from 260" from the questions.

7 [C] Since, $\sigma$ is unknow, use $t$ distribution.

8 [A] Intrepretation of the estimate of the slope coefficient.

* * * 

### T/F questions

9a [T]

9b [F] p.220 $\tilde{\beta}\sim G(\beta,\frac{\sigma}{S_{xx}})$.

9c [T]

* p.134, Defn. 24. $R(\theta_o)=\frac{L(\theta_o)}{L(\tilde{\theta})}$

* p.148, $\Gamma=-2\ln\frac{L(\theta_o)}{L(\tilde{\theta})}$

9d [F]

9e [E]. p.194, the last line. Note: it is always the **approximation**

* * *

### Written question

10

* page.192, testing $\sigma$ from $G(\mu, \sigma)$, where
$$\frac{(n-1)s^2}{\sigma^2}=\frac{1}{\sigma^2}\sum\_{i=1}^n (Y_i-\bar{Y}) \sim \chi^2\_{n-1}$$

* This is **two-sided $H_a$**.

11

* Be careful the MLE is obtained from $\tilde{\theta}=\frac{y}{n}$.

* The relationship between $chi^2$ and normal/gaussian distribution.
