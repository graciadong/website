This site is for Chi-Kuang's personal use for University of Waterloo's **Statistics 231** course, Spring 2019. I will put some stuff I taught during the tutorial here. 

***My Office Hour***: Tuesday 9:00 - 10:00.

***Note***: I'll try my best not to, but I might make some mistakes, so use at your own risk!!! Also, feel free to contact me if you spot any errors.
