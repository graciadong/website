In this tutorial, we'll go over the quiz ([Version B](../supp/tut3_Q.pdf)) that the students wrote last week.

# Q1 

The solution can be found [here](../supp/tut3_Q1.pdf).

# Q2

* a & b

You may read the following for good references:

  1. [1](https://seankross.com/2016/02/29/A-Q-Q-Plot-Dissection-Kit.html)

  2. [2](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/101274/how-to-interpret-a-qq-plot)

  3. [3](http://www.ucd.ie/ecomodel/Resources/QQplots_WebVersion.html)

* c

    Simply apply the CLT.

* d

Know the formula: $$\bar{y}\pm Z\_{pt}\sigma/\sqrt{n}$$.

If $n$ increase by 4, then $\sqrt{n}$ will be 2. So divide by 2 resulting the CI to be **half** of the original

* e

95% CI, $Z\_{0.975}=1.96$ v.s. 99% CI, $Z\_{0.995}=2.576$. So higher $(1-\alpha)\%$ value, the **Wider** the CI be.

* f

Can be easily shown be drawing the plot (move the intersecting line upward).

* g

Definition 21 on page 107

* h

Definition 19 on page 106.

# Q3 

* a 

A good definition of binomila is on Q5.1 (a), page 373, the first 4 lines.

* b

Note: The MLE is $\hat{p}=\bar{x}=\sum{x_i}/n$

# Q4

* c

Table 4.2 on page 135

* e

Can look at Figure 4.4 on page 136

* f

Again, CLT is the essential part for this question.
