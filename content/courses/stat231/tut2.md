In this tutorial, we'll go over the quiz (**Version B**) that the students wrote last week.

# Q1 

### a)

ANS: B

Reason:

rnorm(n, mean, sd)

round(#, digits)

### b)

ANS: D

Reason:

A,B -- cannot tell as it's a categorical variable

C -- cannot tell as we can rearrange the order

D -- True

### c)

ANS: C

Reason:

(I) -- False (eyeball)

(II) -- Recall the relationship between boxplot and histrogram/density plot

### d)

ANS: C

Reason:

Definition [Range]: $$y\_{n}-y\_{1}.$$

In this case, n=6, so $$y\_6-y\_1.$$

### e)

ANS: B

Reason:

Pie/Bar -- suitable for categorical, **not** numerical

Run chart -- show individual data points in chronological order. Good for summarizing data collected over time

Median: Yes, more robust than mean.

# Q2

The soltuion can be found [here](../tut2_Q2.pdf).

# Q3

Be able to read the CDF plot.

### d)

Symmetric. Mean = Median = 4.

# Q4

The solution can be found [here](../tut2_Q4.pdf).

# Q5

Similar to example 1.4.1 

### a)

Unit -- p. 3, the first line under section 1.2.

### b) 

Did not impose any treatments -> observational study or survey.

By definition: Observation study -- "A distinction between a sample survey and an observational study is that for observational studies the population of interest is usually infinite or conceptual."

Make sure you know the difference between

1. Survey

2. Observational study

3. Experimental study

### c)

Sex -- **categorical** (M/F)

Answer from student -- **categorical** (Agree/Disagree)
